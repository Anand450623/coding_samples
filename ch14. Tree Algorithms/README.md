This repository contains sample codes for implementation of basic tree related algorithms.

NOTE: For binary tree, if we know pre/post order traversal with in-order traversal then we can easily construct the tree.
	  But, if we know only the pre-post order traversal we cannot construct the tree as multiple tree structure can give to same pre and post
	  order traveral.
	  
	  Eg. pre-order: [1,2] and post-order: [2,1]
	  These traversal result is same for two trees, with 1 being as the head and 2 being the left child in one case and right in other case.
