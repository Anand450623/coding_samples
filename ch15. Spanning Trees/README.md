This repository contains sample codes for implementation of spanning tree algorithms.

NOTE : As an extra step for the codes in repo, some optimization can be implemented in terms of terminating conditions :

1. Prim's Algo : Uses Adjacency list and Binary Heaps.
				 Search should be terminated as and when all the nodes are discovered by algorithm.
				 
2. Kruskal's Algo : Uses Component analysis and edgeList.
					Search should be terminated when n-1 edges are discovered by algorithm where n is the number of vertices.
					
Both Prim's and Kruskal are greedy algorithm.
